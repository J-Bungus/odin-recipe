        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This is a recipe from the blog "The Woks of Life". The original article can
            be found <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/shanghai-style-braised-pork-belly/">here</a>.

            Shanghai-Style Braised Pork Belly, also known as Hong Shao Rou, is a delicious dish common throughout
            China. It mixes sweet and salty to create a wonderful emalgamation of flavour. Braising the meat gives
            it a soft and tender texture, making it suitable for young children and the elderly. This recipe is 
            made for 3 people and is one of my favourite dishes.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces lean, skin-on, pork belly</li>
            <li>2 tablespoones oil (any kind)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon rock sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Shaoxing wine</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by cutting your pork belly into 3/4-inch thick pieces.</li>
            <li>
                Bring a pot of water to a boil. Blanch the pork belly pieces for a couple minutes. This gets rid of 
                impurities and starts the cooking process. Take the pork out of the pot, rinse, and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Over low heat, add the oil and sugar to your wok. Melt the sugar slightly and add the pork. Raise 
                the heat to medium and cook until the pork is lightly browned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn the heat back down to low and add shaoxing cooking wine, regular soy sauce, dark soy sauce,
                 and water.
            </li>
            <li>
                NOTE: Itâ€™s very important to the color and flavor of this dish that you have both kinds of soy
                sauce! Just head to your local Asian market, buy a bottle of each, and it will last you a year!
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover and simmer over medium heat for about 45 minutes to 1 hour until pork is fork tender. Every 
                5-10 minutes, stir to prevent burning and add more water if it gets too dry.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the pork is fork tender, if there is still a lot of visible liquid, uncover the wok, turn up 
                the heat, and stir continuously until the sauce has reduced to a glistening coating.
            </li>
        </ol>
